## The Project

CounterApp is a simple counter program that increases and decreases the number based on the user's selection.
<br>
<br>
The program begins by defining the functions myUpFunction () and myDownFunction () to increase and decrease the number set in the variable.
<br>
<br>
The functions are called through an event listener (addEventListener) which, according to the button clicked by the user, increases or decreases the displayed number.
